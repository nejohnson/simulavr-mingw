  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>
    The SimulAVR program is a simulator for the
    <a href="https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/8-bit/avr-mcus/device-selection">Atmel AVR family</a>
    (now on Microchip) of microcontrollers. (ATtiny and ATmega) SimulAVR can
    be used either standalone or as a remote target for avr-gdb. There is a
    python- and TCL interface. When used in gdbserver mode, the simulator is
    used as a back-end so that avr-gdb can be used as a source level debugger
    for AVR programs.</p>

  <p>
    SimulAVR started out as a C based project written by Theodore Roth in 2001.
    Klaus Rudolph started then in 2004 to rewrite the hardware simulation part
    in C++. Only the instruction decoder and the avr-gdb interface are mostly
    copied from the original simulavr sources. This C++ based version was known
    as simulavrxx until it became feature compatibile with the old simulavr
    code, then it renamed back to simulavr.</p>

    (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/simulavr-devel">see archive</a>) and

    Please read more <a href="{{ pathto('contents') }}">about activities,
    plans, releases, download</a> and so one.</p>
  
  <p>
    We hold also the "old" code and releases from simulavr and simulavrxx for
    maintenance and for comparison reasons. There is some maintenance for the
    "old" C based simulavr, especially to support projects, which use simulavr.
    <b>But we recommend to use the new simulavr version soon!</b></p>
